# Dungeons-and-Lizards

(legacy versions have spaces in filename)

Text-based Role Playing Game on the command line built using Python.

Explore a strange world as yourself! Start off with nothing but a little gold in your pocket, but slowly grow your strength through leveling up and utilizing items. 

This game can be played by anyone! However, tread carefully since death is permanent...

The combat features timed inputs and a variety of possible combat actions to create a sense of intensity and a skill ceiling using the limited tools available for this project. 

## Motivation

I love video games and I am always interested in what goes into making an engaging experience for a user. I also wanted to learn about Python so I figured I could explore both interests by creating a Python RPG! 

## What I learned

This is my second Python project. It took me much longer than I expected, as I wanted to make sure the core mechanics were engaging and that locations were at least somewhat interesting with interesting dialogue/text to read. One of my main goals with the project was to make it scalable and expandable, which I accomplished using a world system that can be added onto infinitely. I learned about challenges that come with user inputs, displaying strings, and much more. I also got to solidify my mastery of Python syntax as I had just learned Python when making this game.

Creating this game also taught me another important lesson about setting realisitc goals. With almost 2000 lines of code and excessive StackOverflow browsing, I may have been too ambitious in my goals for the game. However, I am glad that I stuck with it and created a working game with at least a small layer of depth to it!
