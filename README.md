# Dungeons-and-Lizards

Text-based Role Playing Game on the command line built using Python.

Explore a strange world as yourself! Start off with nothing but a little gold in your pocket, but slowly grow your strength through leveling up and utilizing items. 

This game can be played by anyone! However, tread carefully since death is permanent...

The combat features timed inputs and a variety of possible combat actions to create a sense of intensity and a skill ceiling using the limited tools available for this project. 

This is my second Python project. It took me much longer than I expected, as I wanted to make sure the core mechanics were engaging and that locations were at least somewhat interesting with interesting dialogue/text to read. It's not AAA material, but I liked the final result.
Let me know if there are any bugs/problems/improvements to be made!

(While most of the core mechanics that I wanted have been implemented, the game world is limited. However, it is expandable and can easily accomodate additional content.)
